# Song searcher for karaoke nights of fun and merriment

This is a simple react app that parses a songlist.csv file.  This
should be maintainable by anyone who can use Numbers or Excel.  All you need
to do is build the app and keep your song list up to date.


# instructions
I've checked in a copy that is all built, so you should just be able to clone
the repository on a local machine, then in a web browser navigate to
.../bkaraoke/app/index.html either as a file or on your local webserver
