# Kelly Karaoke

New Version, updated to a more modern react.  To get this up super fast, you need the hosting and the database details setting up in the Google Firebase console.




Things to do to get it working

1 - make sure you have a file called secrets.js in the /src/ directory.  All this needs is contents that look just like this...

	export const firebaseConfig={
	  apiKey: "something",
	  authDomain: "blah",
	  databaseURL: "beep",
	  projectId: "bop",
	  storageBucket: "boop",
	  messagingSenderId: "123412341234",
	  appId: "1:1234:web:1234e1234b1234"
	}

This comes from the google firebase admin control panel.

2 - have a dev environment that will let you type

	> yarn start

This will bring up a dev server to test that the above details are all OK.  If that's all dandy, then run

3 - Build it all with

	> yarn build

4 - Put it on the internet with

	> firebase deploy.














Things below here are the create-react-app boilerplate.






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
